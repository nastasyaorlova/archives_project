&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, I see now from the liner notes that the recording itself was done at Bow Lane and that the mastering took place at Trend. Correction made – thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thanks as well for being such a good sport regarding my rather harsh take on Healy&#039;s work – it should in no way be seen as a slight on the production work which, from what I can tell, was impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I utterly hold fast to what I wrote about Healy, but of course I fully recognize my opinion to be far from universal.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the photo caption is not quite correct. The recording studio is TREND STUDIOS, in it’s second location on Sth Prince’s Street. It’s also the location for the amazing recording of FW by Patrick Healy, the CD mastering followed later. I hold the copy of the book which Patrick read from, with his many notations and highlights! &lt;br&gt;Paul Waldron&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all the great teaching. One thing I don&#039;t see mentioned in recent years is the Finnegans Wake topic book &quot;War and Peace in the Global Village&quot; by Marshall McLuhan in 1968... I&#039;ve been creating a multimedia Earwicker Pub Crawl centered on it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://WakeIndra.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://WakeIndra.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really appreciate your work, thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Simon Loekle’s Finnegans Wake In 1996, Simon Loekle began reading Finnegans Wake on WBAI’s As I Please: The Year-Out Wake Show. Unfortunately, his death in 2015 cut the project short. Once again doing God’s work, JoyceGeek has archived and organized all of Loekle’s readings on a single page. These readings are wonderful, the perfect combination of Joycean scholarship and dramatic sensibility. Highly recommended! [&#8230;]]]></description>

@Phillip
Fairly simple, really: Powerpoint, Final Cut Pro, and pretty much all of my spare time. Look for more of this kind of stuff in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future...]]></description>

Can’t believe I have not run into you before. I have one entry in Fweet, although after maybe 60 trays since I first encountered FB, I cannot say I have finished it; I have swum it it happily, however. A favor: How do you make your words swim all over your animations?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this! This is terrific, great work, and witty as always. Horgan’s recording absolutely needs more support and exposure. 

Also: I was a fan of “Longmire”—I’ll have to seek you out on AMC+!]]></description>
